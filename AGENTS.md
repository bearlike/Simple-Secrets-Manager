# AGENTS

## Repository scope

This is a monorepo with:

- Backend API at repository root.
- Frontend Admin Console at `frontend/`.

## Instruction hierarchy (authoritative)

- This root `AGENTS.md` is mandatory baseline guidance for the entire monorepo.
- Subproject `AGENTS.md` files are also mandatory when working inside their directory tree.
- Always load and follow the nearest `AGENTS.md` for every file you touch, in addition to this root file.
- If guidance conflicts, the nearest (most specific) `AGENTS.md` for the changed file wins, and root rules still apply where they do not conflict.
- Continuously capture non-trivial lessons from implementation work and document the most important ones in the appropriate `AGENTS.md` (root and/or subproject) so future sessions accelerate delivery and workflow quality.
- Known subproject instruction files in this repo:
  - `frontend/AGENTS.md` for all work under `frontend/`.

## Backend working rules

- Run backend quality checks with `./scripts/quality.sh check`.
- Keep API response contracts stable unless an explicit versioned change is requested.
- Do not remove legacy `/api/secrets/kv` endpoints.

## Frontend working rules

- Run frontend checks with:
  - `cd frontend && npm run lint`
  - `cd frontend && npm run build`
- Frontend talks to backend using `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (defaults to `/api`).

## Docker workflows

- Full stack: `docker compose up -d --build`
- Frontend: `http://localhost:8080`
- Backend API via proxy: `http://localhost:8080/api`
- Backend API direct: `http://localhost:5000/api`

## Knowledge

- When you have access to MCP tools like DeepWiki, use them to investigate the `bearlike/Simple-Secrets-Manager` repository directly. 
  - Ask targeted questions about the codebase to understand how it works. You can use DeepWiki for any open source repository.  
  - Focus specifically on the open-source, publicly available GitHub repository. This lets you dig into the implementation details without guessing.
- Always test and lint the codebase after changes.
- Playwright MCP tool, when accessible, can be used for testing front-end components and changes. 
- Always scan related components to ensure consistency. Keep things stupid simple (KISS) and don't repeat yourself (DRY). This prevents code bloat. We need to avoid overengineering.

## Session lessons (non-trivial)

- `git push` can be blocked by a pre-push hook when the working tree is dirty, even if the dirty files are unrelated to the commit being pushed.
  - Practical workflow: temporarily stash unrelated local edits, push, then restore with `git stash pop`.
- Keep React Query derived views under the same key prefix when possible (for example, `['secrets', projectSlug, configSlug, ...]`) so existing prefix invalidation still refreshes all related views.
- Secret icon persistence now distinguishes `icon_source` as `auto` or `manual`; project-wide icon recompute should only rewrite `auto` entries so explicit manual overrides remain stable.
- When preparing legacy API removal, deprecate in layers first: code-level `@warnings.deprecated`, OpenAPI `deprecated=true`, and API response deprecation headers, then remove only in a later major release.

### Workflow

**Follow these steps:**

1. Run `git status` to review changed files.
2. Run `git diff` or `git diff --cached` to inspect changes.
3. Stage your changes with `git add <file>`.
4. Construct your commit message using the following XML structure.
5. After generating your commit message, Copilot will automatically run the following command in your integrated terminal (no confirmation needed):

```bash
git commit -m "type(scope): description"
```

6. Just execute this prompt and Copilot will handle the commit for you in the terminal.

### Commit Message Structure

```xml
<commit-message>
	<type>feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|chore|revert</type>
	<scope>(api|frontend|cli|...)</scope> What core project/lib is being worked on
	<description>A short, imperative summary of the change.</description>
	<body>(optional: more detailed explanation)</body>
	<footer>(optional: e.g. BREAKING CHANGE: details, or issue references)</footer>
</commit-message>
```

### Examples

```xml
<examples>
	<example>✨ feat(api): add ability to parse arrays</example>
	<example>🐛 fix(frontend): correct button alignment</example>
	<example>📝  chore(docs): update README with usage instructions</example>
	<example>♻️ refactor(database): improve performance of data processing</example>
	<example>🔧 chore(api): update dependencies</example>
</examples>
```

### Validation

```xml
<validation>
        <gitmoji>✨| 🐛 | ⚡️|🚨 |etc</gitmoji>
	<type>Must be one of the allowed types. See <reference>https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification</reference></type>
	<scope>Optional, but recommended for clarity.</scope>
	<description>Required. Use the imperative mood (e.g., "add", not "added").</description>
	<body>Optional. Use for additional context.</body>
	<footer>Use for breaking changes or issue references.</footer>
</validation>
```

### Final Step

```xml
<final-step>
	<cmd>git commit -m "type(scope): description"</cmd>
	<note>Replace with your constructed message. Include body and footer if needed.</note>
</final-step>
```
